                    <p>Expression through mark-making, gesture, and color is a core part of being human. From the oldest cave paintings on the Iberian Peninsula to a child’s first marks with a crayon, art-making is one of the many means of expression that humans engage with to understand and interpret the world around them. Visual art reaches beyond written and spoken language to access the emotional and psychological inner world of both the maker and the viewer. By creating this dialogue, there is a place to experience the richness and nuance of one’s inner life, foster emotional intelligence, and support mental health.

“Art education is a great way to get kids to explore their own interests and introduces them to the larger world around them,” says Jennifer Lammey, CSU art education alumni and visual arts teacher for the St. Vrain Valley School District. “It creates a safe place to learn about themselves and be creative without a lot of pressure. Art-making naturally raises questions, and it helps kids to find answers to them creatively. It also helps them explore issues, whether it's identity or race or environmental issues, and gives them a visual language to talk about those issues.”

When individuals have a way to express themselves, their community benefits from their well-being. Having access to visual art and experiencing the creation of art helps humans contextualize their experiences and connects them to others through the expression of shared identity. Creating these connections and mutual understanding through art supports interpersonal connection, increases empathy, and facilitates healthy relationships between individuals and society.

Early art education is fundamental to the development of these emotional and psychological skills. The Art Education program in the Department of Art and Art History engages with art departments in local school districts through community-based art education to help young people practice these important skill sets. Community-based art education is when the teacher acts as a facilitator and mediator between the students and the community in which they live. It  is a collaboration between students and their teacher, and the curriculum is usually tailored to the students' needs. This can take the form of organized community art programs to improve art skills or outreach programs to empower special groups of people.

“Community-based art education encourages learners to make connections between their art education in a classroom setting and its application in the community beyond school, with demonstrable examples of how the arts impact responsible citizenship,” says Patrick Fahey, associate professor of art education. “There are many approaches to work in and effect change in the community. Such approaches promote contextual learning about local art and culture, at the same time helping the community and highlighting the needs of marginalized citizens.”</p>

            <p>Pablo Diego José Francisco de Paula Juan Nepomuceno María de los Remedios Cipriano de la Santísima Trinidad Ruiz y Picasso[a][b] (25 October 1881 – 8 April 1973) was a Spanish painter, sculptor, printmaker, ceramicist, and theatre designer who spent most of his adult life in France. One of the most influential artists of the 20th century, he is known for co-founding the Cubist movement, the invention of constructed sculpture,[8][9] the co-invention of collage, and for the wide variety of styles that he helped develop and explore. Among his most famous works are the proto-Cubist Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907) and the anti-war painting Guernica (1937), a dramatic portrayal of the bombing of Guernica by German and Italian air forces during the Spanish Civil War.Beginning his formal training under his father José Ruiz y Blasco aged seven, Picasso demonstrated extraordinary artistic talent from a young age, painting in a naturalistic manner through his childhood and adolescence. During the first decade of the 20th century, his style changed as he experimented with different theories, techniques, and ideas. After 1906, the Fauvist work of the older artist Henri Matisse motivated Picasso to explore more radical styles, beginning a fruitful rivalry between the two artists, who subsequently were often paired by critics as the leaders of modern art.[10][11][12][13]

Picasso's output, especially in his early career, is often periodized. While the names of many of his later periods are debated, the most commonly accepted periods in his work are the Blue Period (1901–1904), the Rose Period (1904–1906), the African-influenced Period (1907–1909), Analytic Cubism (1909–1912), and Synthetic Cubism (1912–1919), also referred to as the Crystal period. Much of Picasso's work of the late 1910s and early 1920s is in a neoclassical style, and his work in the mid-1920s often has characteristics of Surrealism. His later work often combines elements of his earlier styles.

Exceptionally prolific throughout the course of his long life, Picasso achieved universal renown and immense fortune for his revolutionary artistic accomplishments, and became one of the best-known figures in</p>
